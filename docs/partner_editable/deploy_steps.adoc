// We need to work around Step numbers here if we are going to potentially exclude the AMI subscription

=== Subscribe to the {partner-product-short-name} AMI

This Quick Start requires a subscription to the AMI for {partner-product-short-name} in AWS Marketplace.

. {marketplace_listing_url}[Open the page for the {partner-product-short-name} AMI in AWS Marketplace], and then choose *Continue to Subscribe*.
. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*. +
  A confirmation page loads, and an email confirmation is sent to the account owner. For detailed subscription instructions, see the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[AWS Marketplace documentation^].

=== AWS CDK Deployment

First you need to make sure you have the AWS CDK installed on your development machine. 

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites[CDK Prerequiesites]

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install[Install the AWS CDK]

* Clone the repo, build the project, and then boostrap your AWS account for the AWS CDK.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-startup-blueprint.git
npm run build 
cdk bootstrap
```

* Feel free to review the code and make any changes you see fit. For example, you might want to use different VPC CIDR ranges (`aws-vpcs.ts`) or a different internal DNS apex (`aws-dns.ts` defaults to corp). 

When you are ready, or when you need update the blueprint's architecture in the future based on changes you make, you just need to run:

```bash 
npm run build && cdk deploy
```
